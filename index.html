                <p>
                    The Cooking Stories mobile application is accessible to
                    individuals who have enrolled in a research study at Indiana
                    University (IU), which has been approved by IU's
                    institutional review board (#17298). This privacy reiterates
                    the information contained in the Informed Consent document,
                    which all study participants must read and agree to in order
                    to enroll in the study
                </p>

                <h4>Developer Information & Privacy Contact</h4>
                <p>
                    This app was developed by Informatics researchers at Indiana
                    University. If you have questions about your data privacy,
                    please email Colin LeFevre (one of the researchers) at
                    <a href="mailto: clefevr@iu.edu">clefevr@iu.edu.</a>
                </p>

                <h4>Data Disclosure</h4>
                <p>
                    This app allows users to share their cooking with friends
                    and family. To that end, it collects the following sensitive
                    data with user permission:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Identifying information: name, email address, textual
                        descriptions of personal experiences
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Authentication information: account username and
                        password
                    </li>
                    <li>Other sensitive information: camera / photos</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Choosing to create an in-app post will share the following
                    data with users you have added as in-app friends: name,
                    textual descriptions of experience, and photos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following data is accessible to the researchers
                    conducting this study, including but not limited to
                    developers: name, email address, account username, textual
                    descriptions of experiences, and photos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your account password is NOT accessible to either the
                    researchers conducting this story or in-app friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, the photos and textual descriptions of
                    experiences you choose to upload to the app may be shared in
                    research publications or with Indiana University's IRB. In
                    these cases, this information will be anonymized, i.e., no
                    identifying information will be included.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your sensitive data will not be shared with any parties
                    beyond those listed above.
                </p>

                <h4>Secure Data Handling Procedures</h4>
                <p>
                    This app uses Firebase to store user data. As such, all user
                    data is encrypted in transand at rest used AES256
                    encryption. For more information, please refer to the
                    <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy"
                        >Firebase Privacy & Security</a
                    >
                    page.
                </p>

                <h4>Data Retention and Deletion</h4>
                <p>
                    App users' data will be retained, at a minimum, for the
                    duration of their participation in the study. If a user does
                    not fully complete the study, their data will be deleted
                    when they exit the study. If a user does fully complete the
                    study, their data will be deleted once the overall research
                    study has been completed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users may request for their data to be deleted prior to
                    overall research study completion. Be advised, however, that
                    this request will entail removing all participant data from
                    the overall study.
